# Designing-DVB_T-Receivers
DVB-T is an abbreviation for digital video broadcasting terrestrial. It is the standard we use in digital TVs in Asia and Europe. I was working on the channel decoder part of digital televisions in this project. My task was to design a channel decoder for the receiver, which does error correction and deletes the noises from the received signals. On a rainy or stormy day, You may have experienced that you can not watch TV. The receiver can not delete the noises from the received signals. If we try to lower the hardware complexities existing for the receiver, we can design a receiver that can delete the noise from the received signals in these situations, too.
